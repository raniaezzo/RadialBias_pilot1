This experiment is deigned to measure radial direction bias at given eccentricities and polar angles.
The presented stimulus during each trial is a drifting grating, and the subject is instructed to determine 
whether the direction of drift is (a) clockwise or (b) counterclockwise relative to an internal reference frame.
The internal reference frame will either be the radial axis (relative to central fixation), or the tangential axis (relative to central fixation).
This experiment includes 3 modalities: practice, thresholding, and experimental. The thresholding uses a staircase method to 
determine optimal spacing of the clockwise/counterclockwise tilt relative to the internal reference frame.
